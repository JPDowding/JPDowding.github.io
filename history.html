    <h3>History</h3>

          <p>Situated near Springdale in southwestern Utah, Zion National Park 
            is one of America's most popular national parks. This remarkable park 
            might very well be called Mukuntuweap National Park today were it not 
            for unhappy Mormons and a faithful sidekick standing in for an iconic 
            National Park Director who suffered terrible bouts of depression. 
            It's a fascinating story.
            </p>
            <p>In the early 1850s, Mormon pioneers dispatched from Salt Lake City 
            by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints leadership became 
            the first white settlers of the Virgin River region in southwestern 
            Utah. In 1851 they settled in the Cedar City area and began growing 
            cotton and other crops. (Historians know this as the “cotton campaign,” 
            and the early Mormon cotton growing region of the southern Utah plateaus
            is known as “Mormon Dixie.”) By 1858, the Mormon-settled area had pushed 
            75 miles up the Virgin River corridor into the immediate vicinity of Zion 
            Canyon. At this time, these remote canyonlands were wild and barely explored.
            </p>
            <p>The remarkable physical feature we now call Zion Canyon is located on 
            the southern part of the Markagunt Plateau where it is deeply dissected 
            by the Virgin River and its tributaries. Erosion has left deep canyons 
            (slot-like in many places), soaring cliffs, and huge monoliths. Though 
            strikingly beautiful, this was a harsh environment. And it belonged to 
            the Southern Paiute Indians.
            </p>
            <p>Before a settlement toehold could be established, the Mormons first 
            had to know what sort of a place it was and whether it could be farmed. 
            This exploration task was assigned to a young Mormon missionary and translator 
            named Nephi Johnson. Enlisting the aid of a Southern Pauite guide, Johnson made 
            his way into the main canyon in 1858. Upon his return, he rendered a favorable 
            report on the agricultural potential of the canyon floor.
            </p>
            <p>In 1861, Mormon pioneer Joseph Black became the first white to establish
            a farm on the narrow canyon floor. By 1862, several farming families had 
            founded the town of Springdale just outside the mouth of Zion Canyon. 
            In 1863, a Mormon settler named Isaac Behunin built a one-room log cabin 
            (near the site of Zion Lodge) and farmed tobacco, sugar cane, and fruit trees. 
            It was Behunin who named the place Zion Canyon.
            </p>
            <p>Zion is a biblical word meaning a place of peace and refuge or sanctuary. 
            It is an exceedingly important word to Mormons because it symbolizes a concept 
            to their history, or more specifically, to their heritage as refugees and pioneers 
            in the western U.S. Persecuted in the eastern states, the early Mormons fled to 
            the Great Basin and the Rocky Mountains beginning on the late 1840s. The Mormon 
            pioneers who struggled to establish an essentially independent Mormon realm (Deseret) 
            are said to have “gathered to Zion.” Eventually, the term Zion itself took on meaning 
            as a symbol of Mormonism, embracing such qualities as courage, dedication to the cause, 
            physical endurance, resoluteness, ingenuity, and faith.
