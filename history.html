          <h4>Summary</h4>

          <p>Situated near Springdale in southwestern Utah, Zion National Park is 
            Utah's first and oldest national park. By Presidential Executive Order
            of William Howard Taft in 1909, Mukuntuweap (now known 
            as Zion) was identified as a great tourist location and given the 
            status of  National Monument.  Although this was a boost for the 
            state of Utah, the Monument was inaccessible to tourists due to the poor 
            condition of the road. The Utah State Road Commission began construction and 
            negotiated with the Union Pacific Railroad to provide rail and automobile 
            links along with tourism facilities in southern Utah. Zion National Monument was
            given the prestigious designation of Zion National Park in 1919. In 1937, President
            Franklin D. Roosevelt established a second Zion National Monument, which is now 
            referred to as Kolob Canyons, and was incorporated with Zion National Park in 
            1956. Today, Zion is the third most visited National Park in the country. In 
            2023, Zion had 4,623,238 visitors.
          </p>

          <h4>Native People: the Pueblo & Paiute</h4>

          <p>Ancestral Pueblo Indians (aka Anasazi, aka Mokis) lived in Parunaweap 
            canyon from 500 AD to about 1300 AD. These settlements were the furthest 
            west Anasazi villages, and were somewhat isolated from the main culture, 
            developing unique styles. 
            </p>
          <p>
            When the first white settlers arrived in the 1850s, Southern Paiute Indians 
            inhabited the area. The Paiutes shunned Zion Canyon as a place of mysterious 
            happenings - not a good place to be after dark! Many Zion place names come
            from Paiute theology including Mount Wynopits (after Wynopits, the God of Evil)
            and Mount Kinesava (after Kinesava, the Trickster).
            </p>

          <h4>Mormon Pioneers</h4>

          <p>In the early 1850s, Mormon pioneers dispatched from Salt Lake City 
            by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints leadership became 
            the first white settlers of the Virgin River region in southwestern 
            Utah. In 1851 they settled in the Cedar City area and began growing 
            cotton and other crops. (Historians know this as the “cotton campaign,” 
            and the early Mormon cotton growing region of the southern Utah plateaus
            is known as “Mormon Dixie.”) By 1858, the Mormon-settled area had pushed 
            75 miles up the Virgin River corridor into the immediate vicinity of Zion 
            Canyon. At this time, these remote canyonlands were wild and barely explored.
            </p>
          <p>The remarkable physical feature we now call Zion Canyon is located on 
            the southern part of the Markagunt Plateau where it is deeply dissected 
            by the Virgin River and its tributaries. Erosion has left deep canyons 
            (slot-like in many places), soaring cliffs, and huge monoliths. Though 
            strikingly beautiful, this was a harsh environment. And it belonged to 
            the Southern Paiute Indians.
            </p>
          <p>Before a settlement toehold could be established, the Mormons first 
            had to know what sort of a place it was and whether it could be farmed. 
            This exploration task was assigned to a young Mormon missionary and translator 
            named Nephi Johnson. Enlisting the aid of a Southern Pauite guide, Johnson made 
            his way into the main canyon in 1858. Upon his return, he rendered a favorable 
            report on the agricultural potential of the canyon floor.
            </p>
          <p>In 1861, Mormon pioneer Joseph Black became the first white to establish
            a farm on the narrow canyon floor. By 1862, several farming families had 
            founded the town of Springdale just outside the mouth of Zion Canyon. 
            In 1863, a Mormon settler named Isaac Behunin built a one-room log cabin 
            (near the site of Zion Lodge) and farmed tobacco, sugar cane, and fruit trees. 
            It was Behunin who named the place Zion Canyon.
            </p>
          <p>Zion is a biblical word meaning a place of peace and refuge or sanctuary. 
            It is an exceedingly important word to Mormons because it symbolizes a concept 
            to their history, or more specifically, to their heritage as refugees and pioneers 
            in the western U.S. Persecuted in the eastern states, the early Mormons fled to 
            the Great Basin and the Rocky Mountains beginning on the late 1840s. The Mormon 
            pioneers who struggled to establish an essentially independent Mormon realm (Deseret) 
            are said to have “gathered to Zion.” Eventually, the term Zion itself took on meaning 
            as a symbol of Mormonism, embracing such qualities as courage, dedication to the cause, 
            physical endurance, resoluteness, ingenuity, and faith.

          <h4>A National Park: From Mukutuweap to Zion</h4>

          <p>John Wesley Powell visited the area in 1872, making the first modern descent of the 
            East Fork of the Virgin River (Parunaweap Canyon). The same year, 1872, geologist and 
            explorer Grove Karl Gilbert, working with the Wheeler survey, led the first 
            European-American party down the North Fork of the Virgin from Navajo Lake through 
            the Narrows to Zion Canyon. Major Clarence Dutton, working for the 1875 Powell Survey, 
            visited Zion and waxed poetic about the view: "In an instance, there flashed before us 
            a scene never to be forgotten. In coming time it will, I believe, take rank with a very 
            small number of spectacles, each of which will, in its own way, be regarded as the most 
            exquisite of its kind which the world discloses. The scene before us was The Towers of 
            the Virgin."
            </p>

            <p>Few other outsiders visited the region until a federal land survey in 1908 first exposed the area to the general public. 
              The natural splendor of the region so struck the surveyors, that they encouraged President Taft to protect it. On 
              July 31, 1909, Taft set aside approximately 16,000 acres for Mukuntuweap National Monument to preserve its "many natural 
              features of unusual archaeologic, geologic, and geographic interest." In his proclamation, the President noted the "labyrinth
              of remarkable canyons with highly ornate and beautifully colored walls, in which are plainly recorded the geological events
              of past ages." In 1918 Munkutuweap National Monument became Zion National Monument, and in 1919 the named changed again to 
              Zion National Park. On January 22, 1937 President Roosevelt established a second Zion National Monument, preserving over 
              36,000 acres. The second Zion National Monument, which is now referred to as Kolob Canyons, was incorporated with Zion 
              National Park in 1956.
            </p>

            <p>Visitor numbers at Zion National Park have continued to increase over time, necessitating the construction of trails, 
              campgrounds, and other facilities. The economic benefits of tourism now support the small communities surrounding the park, 
              ensuring their survival into a new millennium of human history.
