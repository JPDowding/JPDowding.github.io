          <h5>Desert Bighorn Sheep</h5>
          <p>Desert bighorn sheep are true survivors, adapted to extremes. Cloven hooves give them the grace
             to skillfully move across rugged terrain, but they can also travel great distances across valleys 
             to reach distant habitat.

          <h5>Mountain Lion</h5>
          <p>Mountain lions are very rarely seen within the park, and typically avoid the crowded
             main canyon. However, sightings have been reported in the Kolob Canyons section of Zion, 
             and motion-activated cameras in Zion's backcountry document the presence of these elusive 
             animals.

          <h5>Mule Deer</h5>
          <p>A common sight in Zion, these graceful creatures can often be seen grazing in the meadows 
             or taking a sip from the Virgin River. They are named for their large mule-like ears. Mule deer 
             tend to have bodies that are a bit larger and heavier than white-tailed deer.

          <h5>Ringtail Cat</h5>
          <p>A relatively large population of ringtails exists in Zion National Park. The ringtail is related to the 
            raccoon and is completely nocturnal. With big eyes, bigger ears, and a black and white striped tail, they 
            seem like a fairy tale critter. However, they are very real, albeit elusive and extremely smart.

          <h5>Bald Eagle</h5>
          <p>Winter is an especially good time of year to quietly observe bald eagles, as they migrate into the park 
             from Canada and Alaska for their winter rest. These majestic birds are known for their striking white heads 
             and tails and can be spotted fishing in the park's rivers. Although they were de-listed as endangered species
             in 2007, bald eagles are still protected under federal law.

          <h5>California Condor</h5>
          <p>With a wingspan of 9.5 feet and weighing up to 25 pounds, the California condor is the largest land bird 
             in North America. California condors are curious and attracted to human activity. They are frequently seen 
             in Zion perched on or soaring above Angels Landing, and on the Kolob Terrace Road near Lava Point.

          <h5>Mexican Spotted Owl</h5>
          <p>The Mexican spotted owl ranks as one of the largest owls in North America. The average length 16-19 inches; average
             wingspan is 42-45 inches; and average weight is 19.5-23 ounces. Mexican spotted owls roost during the day and hunt 
             at dusk and at night. Average life expectancy for Mexican spotted owls in the wild is about 15 years.

          <h5>Peregrine Falcon</h5>
          <p>The open landscape and high cliffs of Zion are perfect habitat for peregrine falcons. Crevices found in the sheer rock faces 
             within the park, including those on Angels Landing, serve as nesting locations for peregrines to rear their chicks. Climbing 
             routes on any cliffs used by nesting peregrines temporarily close every year from March 1 to mid- to late-summer in order to 
             protect the birds and their young.
